Extended Abstract (mandatory format from committee) Background: According to the Japan Center for Economic Research (2023), Japan is projected to experience a labor shortage of up to 11 million workers by 2040. To address this, the Japanese government has expanded its migration policies, notably the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) and the Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) scheme. As of late 2023, over 500,000 Indonesian workers have been legally employed under these programs (BP2MI, 2023). However, the increasing scale of migration raises concerns beyond economics—particularly in legal and social protection. These concerns underscore the urgent need for proactive and inclusive measures that not only facilitate placement but also uphold the dignity and rights of migrant workers at every stage of their journey. Problem: Despite the growing demand for Indonesian workers, reports by Migrant Care (2022) indicate that approximately 1,800 workers have overstayed or violated work permits, often due to misunderstandings or misleading terms in employment contracts. A key issue is the lack of legal literacy among migrant workers, who typically have limited access to digital tools for reviewing legal documents. Workers often sign contracts without fully understanding clauses related to working hours, wages, job responsibilities, or termination rights—many of which are crucial to ensuring fair treatment under international labor standards (ILO Convention No. 189, 2011). Consequently, the lack of adequate contract comprehension leads to vulnerabilities that could have been mitigated through accessible pre-departure assistance. Scope: This study proposes an AI-based solution designed as a pre-departure tool for Indonesian migrant workers seeking employment in Japan. The goal is to assist them in understanding and evaluating the fairness and legal soundness of employment contracts before departure, using accessible, explainable, and multilingual technology. By addressing legal literacy through technological means, this initiative fills a critical gap in the migrant worker protection ecosystem—where time constraints, regional disparities, and language barriers have long posed challenges for effective pre-departure preparation. Methods:  Theoretical Foundation__The system design draws upon theories of legal literacy and worker empowerment, integrated with practical applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI. The model is built to recognize and assess standard legal terms within the context of labor contracts, referencing core worker rights as outlined by both Indonesian and Japanese regulations. This framework also considers behavioral factors affecting comprehension and trust in digital tools, ensuring the platform is not only technically sound but also socially acceptable for its target users. Application Design & Input–Output Logic__The AI system comprises four core components: Multilingual NLP Module, trained specifically on legal terminology found in labor contracts; Risk Classification Engine, using annotated datasets containing examples of common and problematic contract clauses; Explainable AI Layer, which converts technical legal jargon into plain language explanations; Interactive Dashboard, offering context-specific recommendations and flags for further consultation. Training Data (Model Input)__The system was trained using anonymized samples of real-world employment agreements and cooperation contracts, focusing on detecting violations such as wage manipulation, unregulated overtime, and vague job descriptions. These documents are not distributed but solely used to enhance model accuracy and generalizability. To further improve transparency and fairness, ethical considerations were also embedded in the training process, with careful curation of datasets to avoid reinforcing bias. User-Level Input and Output__At the application level, users input a scanned or digital version of their employment contract. The output includes: An assessment of whether the contract meets minimum worker rights (e.g., clear wages, working hours, health insurance, freedom to resign); Risk alerts for potential exploitative clauses; Suggested actions or points to clarify with employers or authorities; This structure is intentionally designed to be user-centric and action-oriented, helping workers make informed decisions in a timely manner. Results: Initial testing using a synthetic dataset of employment contract excerpts (developed based on anonymized real samples) yielded promising results. The model achieved an average F1-score of 0.80 in classifying risky versus fair clauses after several rounds of training. Legal experts from both Indonesian and Japanese backgrounds reviewed the system outputs to validate relevance and ensure cross-jurisdictional compliance. These validation sessions also served as knowledge exchange opportunities, strengthening the system’s ability to respond to diverse regulatory expectations. Discussion: Compared to traditional pre-departure training (PDT), which relies heavily on seminars and printed materials, this system offers personalized, contract-specific analysis. The tool empowers workers before departure, preventing exploitation at the source rather than post-incident. Furthermore, the model does not replace institutional roles but serves as a legal literacy companion, especially valuable for workers in rural areas who may lack legal assistance. Strategically, this system supports Indonesia’s labor migration digital transformation agenda and aligns with the Indonesia–Japan Strategic Partnership in ensuring fair and transparent labor placement processes. As digital transformation becomes increasingly central to global labor governance, this initiative could also serve as a model for other bilateral migration pathways. Conclusion: This research presents a scalable, ethical, and preventive approach to labor governance using AI-driven tools. By training a generative model on real-world contracts, the system helps identify high-risk clauses before workers commit to overseas employment. The long-term goal is to deploy the system in collaboration with pre-departure centers, government agencies (BP2MI, Ministry of Manpower), and civil society actors. Future iterations will focus on expanding the contract database, 
actualy i ask you to bulid the apps for agreemnet analisys not for make landing page for my abstract, make it good frond ebt, anyway i dont like teh image plis change
lebih kembangkan dong, di sertai contoh hasil analisisnya, dan adain chatbot nta juga, serta warning alert klo ada potensi agreement unfair, ada solusi masalah di poin tertentu, juga rujukan harus mendatangi apa misal kedubes or apa lah, 
where is chatbot feature , and analisis result, and recomendation alert warning 
your result is not good not work
